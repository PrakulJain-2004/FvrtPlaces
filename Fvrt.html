        <h2>1. Starbucks</h2>
        <p>
          Starbucks was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at 
          Seattle's Pike Place Market. During the early 1980s, they sold the company to Howard 
          Schultz who—after a business trip to Milan, Italy—decided to convert the coffee bean
          store into a coffee shop serving espresso-based drinks. As chief executive officer 
          from 1986 to 2000, Schultz's first tenure led to an aggressive expansion of the 
          franchise, first in Seattle, then across the West Coast of the United States. Schultz 
          was succeeded by Orin Smith who ran the company for five years and positioned 
          Starbucks as a large player in fair trade coffee, increasing sales to US$5 trillion
